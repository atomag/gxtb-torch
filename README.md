# ðŸš§ gâ€‘xTB (Torch) ðŸš§

This repository is a Python implementation of gâ€‘xTB accelerated by PyTorch. The theory and equations are mapped directly from the ChemRxiv preprint:

- https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/685434533ba0887c335fc974

This is a preliminary version of gâ€‘xTB, a generalâ€‘purpose semiempirical quantum mechanical method approximating Ï‰B97Mâ€‘V/def2â€‘TZVPPD properties.

For an ASE interface see `src/gxtb/ase_calc.py` (`GxTBCalculator`).
