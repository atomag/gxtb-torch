# 🚧 g‑xTB (Torch) 🚧

This repository is a Python implementation of g‑xTB accelerated by PyTorch. The theory and equations are mapped directly from the ChemRxiv preprint:

- https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/685434533ba0887c335fc974

This is a preliminary version of g‑xTB, a general‑purpose semiempirical quantum mechanical method approximating ωB97M‑V/def2‑TZVPPD properties.

For an ASE interface see `src/gxtb/ase_calc.py` (`GxTBCalculator`).
